Mid-October I handed in my resignation which put and end to one of the most miserable work experiences I had in my
entire career. If you read through the post that [I've written after the first month working there]({{ '/one-month-into-my-new-job-as-the-cto-at-fintura' | prepend:site.baseurl | prepend:site.url }})
you will find me struggling with explaining my idea and values. One of the decisive factors was that I could not 
find support for [my vision]({{ '/motivation' | prepend:site.baseurl | prepend:site.url }}) of what makes a great place to work. 

But in every bad experience there are still things to learn. In no particular order, these were:

* culture: I only want to work with a CEO that I have genuine sympathy for
* values: I need to put more effort into making sure that our goals align (go read [The Big Five for Life](http://amzn.to/1RRg7Nw)) and 
  happiness (or [joy]({{ '/joy-inc' | prepend:site.baseurl | prepend:site.url }}) is a core value
* freedom: I work remotely from day one

Still today I'm struggling with the experiences I made last year. I lost a fair share of trust in people but gained a lot of
confidence that the way I lead is very well received. I cannot but look forward to the next twelve months.
