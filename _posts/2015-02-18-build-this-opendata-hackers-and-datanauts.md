I recently participated in the first meeting of the [Open Knowledge Lab Frankfurt](http://usergroups.rheinmainrocks.de/~oklabffm). The verdict of the meeting was that local OKLabs should focus on building projects that serve a real need and not just be interesting from a developers perspektive … otherwise it wont get noticed by the public and ultimately by local authorities–which are an important source of open data. 

So here is my idea:  
**find the best place to live given the criteria that are important to me and visualize this on a map.**

Let me show you some pictures to illustrate my idea: heat maps help to visualize geologically coded events. The first example is a heat map of the aircraft noise measured during the day:

The second example is the number of crimes committed in Frankfurt's city limits:

If you combine those two you'll get a good idea which neighbourhoods to avoid if you were to move into this region.

And those are just two possible datasource. For me I'd like to see visualization for:
 - public transport time to my workplace
 - prices for land and houses
 - availibility of fast internet access
 - proximity to bioreserves, hiking trails, lakes
 - population density
 - election results
 
This would enable me to pan around a map and find places that would fit my preferred living conditions.

Feel free to submit it to the [TEDxRheinMain Datanauts Contest](http://datanauts.tedxrheinmain.de/), I won't because I'd be force to comply to their [overly one-sided terms and conditions](https://gist.github.com/coderbyheart/344fbd403cfb536d530f).

Also there is the [Open Data Hackathon](http://www.meetup.com/OKLabFfm/events/219670248/) this Saturday at the best coworking space around: [Die Zentrale](http://die-zentrale-ffm.de/). A perfect event to get this started …
