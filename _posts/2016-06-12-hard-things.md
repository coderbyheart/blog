[The Hard Things About Hard Things][1] by [Ben Horowitz][2] is a book for CEOs. 
Horowitz explains in a very easy to read and an entertaining style his learnings
as a CEO. For me it was especially helpful to better understand the role of a
CEO and exciting the get a look into to the decision strategies of a battle-
proven startup founder.

Especially useful for non-CEOs like me and and from a leadership perspective 
are his remarks on the importance of the CEO being the person in an 
organization that is actually in the position to make tough decisions and that 
finding decisions in a commitee does not yield the best decision in the interest 
of the company. In combination with his chapter on the _Peacetime/Wartime CEO_ 
this helps to understand the role of a CEO: companies cant function properly 
without them and they are in a constant state of struggle, often dilemma. The 
hard thing_ is that there is no simple answer to this and they deservere respect 
and forgiveness for their sometimes hard to understand decisions. But only the 
unique position of a CEO who has all knowledge about a business enables thme to 
weigh that information and find the best decision-or just the least bad one. 

Where Horowitz stands out for me is the fact that he goes great length into 
explaining the importance of not letting _politics_ destroy the connection and 
trust employess have to their company. He values the individual learning and 
development over everything else because in the end it will be the strength
of the team that carries a startup through tough times.

The book is a short read and I highly recommend it to (future) entrepreneurs and 
team leads.
