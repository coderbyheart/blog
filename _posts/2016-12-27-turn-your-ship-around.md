[*Turn Your Ship Around!*](http://amzn.to/2hjslhx) by [L. David Marquet][DM] 
is as concrete as it gets for books that promise changing your organization for the better.

Based on the famous book about his tour on the nuclear submarine USS Santa Fee, where Marquet faced
the challenge of his career of becoming the commanding officer on the worst performing ship in the
entire US Navy but managed to turn it into the best performing within two years, the workbook lays
out concrete exercises to implement what Marquet developed: intent-based leadership.

## Intent-based leadership

The method is essentially a helper to codify behavioral change throughout an entire organization.
By making decisions observable by others it enables the transfer of decision making power to
&quot;lower&quot; levels; which is what you want in any complex and complicated environment today.
By *pushing authority to information*, as Marquet calls it, decisions are made where they need to be
made: where and when the action happens, and not many layers distant from it.

The idea is simple: 
to have **leaders on every level**, even at levels where individuals are not used to lead. Obviously 
this skill is not inherently existent everywhere in the organization so Marquet lays out the
ideas and concepts to equip them with mechanisms of *Control* (put them in control of their actions
and results), *Competence* (give the the technical knowledge to make the right decisions), and *Clarity*
(give the the understanding of the organization's purpose). 

You will get more than two dozen exercises
that can be executed in a few minutes and yield material for your team right away. The book is so 
applicable, that no trainer is need, and there are companies that just by following the book, have
saved hundreds of million $.

It not only tackles the common decision fatigue in organizations where it's more important to not
make an error then to make a bold move but makes you discover invisible red-tape, which alone are
potentially limiting your ability to innovate and create compelling products.

The most important aspect of intent-based leadership in my opinion is that it establishes deliberate
learning towards a common goal which enables organizations to grow and become truly agile.
