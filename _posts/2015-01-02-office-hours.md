In the last two years I’ve dived into the Rhein-Main startup scene working for startups and foremost trying to build a solid foundation that enables startups to grow. An important part of this foundation is a network of people you can trust and who can give you unbiased advice without a hidden agenda. Those are hard to find even if I think giving advice can be a lot a fun-which I had at last year's [Startup Weekend Rhein-Main][1].

Even if I believe that Rhein-Main neither can *nor should* follow Berlin's lead in terms of Startups I do want to see disruptive, innovative and creative tech-startups in the area, because those will shape the Rhein-Main area and be built by people I want to work with in the future …

That's why I'll offer free bimonthly office hours either on Google Hangout or at the Coworking Space [Die Zentrale][3] in Frankfurt Bornheim Mitte starting January 2015. Talk to me about technology, building software, managing teams or your organization, whether you have a vague idea or a specific problem. And if I can't help you I'll probably know someone who does.

Email me at [m@coderbyheart.com][2] with a short intro and a link to your LinkedIn or XING profile and pick a free slot and I'll get back to you to confirm our meeting.
