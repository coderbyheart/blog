# RheinMain Tech Cabal

*an evening in the week of March 13th to 19th 2017*  
*no presentations, recruiters, or sales*  
*just drinks and discussion*

The RheinMain Tech Cabal is a closed space for tech people to engage in deep conversations. It will happen on an evening during the week of March 13th to 19th in Frankfurt within the subway grid. The exact day and place will be announced one day before via email.

Questions? Ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderbyheart) or on the [{fradev} slack](https://fradev.herokuapp.com/).


## Tickets

There is a [code of conduct for the cabal](http://confcodeofconduct.com/index.html). You better read it.

### 1. Create a PR

To participate you need to [create a pull request](https://github.com/coderbyheart/blog/edit/gh-pages/rheinmain-tech-cabal.md) and add yourself to the participants list. Only if your PR gets merged you will receive the event details (steps 2 and 3 need to be completed, too). 

### 2. Find a reference

Please ask someone you know and who knows some of the participants to vouch for your authenticity in the PR's comments. The main goal of this event is to keep it real, interesting and free of salespeople and recruiters.

### 3. Pay

A payment of €20 is required [via PayPal](https://paypal.me/coderbyheart) or [via BitCoin](bitcoin:1KX5MQ33Lj2Jr4zVHNykALLCcUrfZZMPSB?amount=0.02597828&message=RHEINMAIN%20TECH%20CABAL) (no refunds!) in order to merge that pull request. Send me [an email](mailto:m@coderbyheart.com) after you have done this. 

### Diversity Tickets

All tickets are pay-it-forward, that means they will enable someone to join, who can't afford the ticket. **If you want to sign up for a diversity ticket**, just drop me an email.

All excess funds and remaining funds for diversity tickets will be donated to [Techettes Frankfurt e.V.](http://techettes-frankfurt.com/).
